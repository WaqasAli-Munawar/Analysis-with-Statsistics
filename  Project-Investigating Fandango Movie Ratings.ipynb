He published his analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) — a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading."

We want to describe the population, so we need to make sure that the samples are representative, otherwise we should expect a large sampling error and, ultimately, wrong conclusions.\n",

    "The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling (Aug. 24, 2015). The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015. The sampling was clearly not random because not every movie had the same chance to be included in the sample — some movies didn't have a chance at all (like those having under 30 fan ratings or those without tickets on sale in 2015). It's questionable whether this sample is representative of the entire population we're interested to describe. It seems more likely that it isn't, mostly because this sample is subject to temporal trends — e.g. movies in 2015 might have been outstandingly good or bad compared to other years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling conditions for our other sample were (as it can be read in the README.md of the data set's repository):\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie must have been released in 2016 or later. The movie must have had a considerable number of votes and reviews (unclear how many from the README.md or from the data). This second sample is also subject to temporal trends and it's unlikely to be representative of our population of interest.\n",

Their sampling method is called [purposive sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdK7N_kTzHI&feature=youtu.be) (or judgmental/selective/subjective sampling). While these samples were good enough for their research, they don't seem too useful for us."

It'd be really interesting to investigate this further — ideally in a separate project, since this is quite irrelevant for the current goal of our analysis.\n",

    "The slight left shift of the 2016 distribution is very interesting for our analysis. It shows that ratings were slightly lower in 2016 compared to 2015. This suggests that there was a difference indeed between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. We can also see the direction of the difference: the ratings in 2016 were slightly lower compared to 2015."
